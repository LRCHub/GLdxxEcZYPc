(Verse One - RZA)
Like Tony Starks man we throw your ass in the Cobra Clutch
Your man watch as your whole head opens up
Sober up, niggy, it's the Bob Digi
We throw darts in the air that float like a frisbee
My neck is frostbitten ...
Love my wares but y'all thug niggas miss me
I'm bionic ... the Digi-juice
My fist ... you better call the jukes
No excuse the black man must stand up
Time to make the Wu sign throw both of y'all hands up
You see me in a Maserati GranTurismo
Up in the club my beat got more sub than Quizno's
Mama that's the business I'ma a get this
Give me ten digits
Fuck that before I quit this
Walk in the prints of a prince
If it don't make it dollas, nigga, then it don't make sense

(Chorus - Dan Auerbach)
If it don't make dollas, then it don't make sense
If it don't make dollas, then it don't make sense
No, no, it don't make sense

(Verse Two - Pharoahe Monch)
I see dead people when I spit with my sixth sense
My sixteens are sick sentences that make sense
Which means they inflict pain that's intense
I got brains backstage I been rhymin' sick since
Sing a song of sixpence
Pockets full of ... 'til I die
... to the sky
My shades is black my boots is ...
Rock 'n' roll I lose control
Fuck the white ones, The Black Keys got so much soul
While you come off of the bench
If it don't make dollas then it don't make sense
If it don't make dollas then it don't make sense
If it don't make dollas then it don't make sense
Dog, It needs to make sense
If it don't make dollas then it don't make sense

(Chorus - Dan Auerbach)
If it don't make dollas then it don't make sense
If it don't make dollas then it don't make sense
No, no, it don't make sense
If it don't make dollas then it don't make sense
If it don't make dollas no it don' t make no sense
