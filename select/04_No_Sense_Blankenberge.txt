Distract yourself
Do anything
Cause it's the only way to live
It's your weapon
To survive
If you still want to
Live this life
Don't think too much
It doesn't work
It can make worse
If you don't stop

Maybe there's no sense anymore
To continue like this
It'll never be the way it was before
But should it be

Life is so beautiful
I know it for sure
Sometimes it seems like a waste of time
But it's not true

Maybe there's no sense anymore
To continue like this
It'll never be the way it was before
But should it be
